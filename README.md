# RIP
Rage Inducing Platformer (RIP) is a 2D platformer built in Unity. The objective is to traverse the dangerous city littered with reminders of your past. You must try to resist these temptations and make it to the finish as fast as possible. There are several ways to die in our game, including by lung cancer from smoking cigarettes, running into a shadow creature, and falling off the platforms. Colliding with a beer bottle disorients the user by randomly shuffling the control inputs for a few seconds.
